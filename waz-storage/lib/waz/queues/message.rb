    # This class is used to model a Message inside Windows Azure Queues the usage
    # it's pretty simple, here you can see a couple of samples. Messages consist on an UTF-8 string up-to 8KB and some metadata
    # regarding its status and visibility. Here are all the things that you can do with a message:
    #
    #  message.message_id #=> returns message id
    #
  	#  # this is the most important method regarding messages
  	#  message.message_text #=> returns message contents
    #  
  	#  message.pop_receipt #=> used for correlating your dequeue request + a delete operation
    #  
  	#  message.expiration_time #=> returns when the message will be removed from the queue
    #
  	#  message.time_next_visible #=> when the message will be visible to other users
    #
  	#  message.insertion_time #=> when the message will be visible to other users
    #
  	#  message.queue_name #=> returns the queue name where the message belongs
    #
  	#  # remove the message from the queue
  	#  message.destroy! 
  	#
